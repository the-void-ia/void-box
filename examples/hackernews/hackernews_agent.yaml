    Use the HackerNews API skill to fetch real data via curl and jq (do NOT use
    WebSearch or WebFetch — use Bash with curl commands from your hackernews-api
    skill). Fetch the top 10 stories with details, then produce a tactical
    briefing for AI engineering teams. Group stories by theme, prioritize by
    engagement density (score/time, comments/time), and extract 3-5 actionable
    signals. Output a clean markdown report with sections: Top Signals, Emerging
    Themes, and Watchlist (next 24h). Include source links. Write the report to
    /workspace/output.md.
